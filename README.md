# allcode.dev

This is the source code for [allcode.dev](https://allcode.dev).
AllCode.Dev teaches programming concepts with a novel approach: instead of learning a single language, you see a number of languages at one time.
This reinforces the underlying concepts of programming, helping learners more clearly see the divide between the syntax and semantics.
