# About allcode.dev

[Rick Osborne](https://rickosborne.org) started allcode.dev in late 2020, but the idea goes back ten years earlier.

Rick used to be a teacher at a university program for Web Design & Development.
During his time there, he taught a number of different programming languages, including PHP, ColdFusion, Javascript, Java, Objective-C, SQL, and more.
In a course for server-side development, he was known for teaching students PHP and ColdFusion side-by-site, on the same whiteboard and in the same editor.

Rick's hypothesis, borne out through years of evidence across hundreds of students, was that programming syntax too often got in the way of learning programming fundamentals.

> Showing _more_ languages at once makes it _easier_ for learners to pick out the common patterns.

allcode.dev is the latest iteration on that idea.
Even though Rick has since gone back to the industry, he still has a passion for teaching.
He hopes his allcode.dev will ignite a shift in how we think about teaching programming, as the industry is only going to grow.
