# Variables

Whether in a program or in any real-life task, you will likely need to keep track of things.
Maybe it's a list of groceries for your next trip to the store.
Or maybe it's jus a mental note to keep track of the name of the person you just met.

> Variables are names for the things your program needs to track.

They are called "variables" because they "vary" — that is, a variable can change as your program runs.

For example, you might create a variable to track your favorite color.
This favorite color might change as you grow older — it varies over time.
That's okay!
Your `favoriteColor` variable will always hold the latest value, whatever it is.

# Parts of a Variable

Variables have only a few parts:

* The **name** of the variable is what you see in the code.

  Example: `favoriteColor` or `groceries`

* The **value** is what you associate with the variable — the thing you're tracking.

  Example: That `favoriteColor` variable might have a value of "blue", or "yellow", etc.

* The **address** is used by the computer to link the **name** and **value**.
  In most modern programming languages, you won't see the address — it's handled behind the scenes for you.
