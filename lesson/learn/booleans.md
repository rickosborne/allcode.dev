# Booleans

At the lowest levels of most computer hardware, everything looks like a `1` or `0` â€” a `true` or `false`.
Values which can be reduced to true/false are called **Boolean** values.
When we write them out in code, they are Boolean [literals](/learn/literal-values/).

To help coders quickly distinguish between Boolean values and numbers beyond `1` and `0`, most programming languages will also offer the reserved keywords `true` and `false` to use in literals:

# Next Steps

* [Variables](/learn/variables/) keep track of your values.
* [Constants](/learn/constants/) are fixed values, often numbers, which never change when your code is run.
