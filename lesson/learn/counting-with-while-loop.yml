explanation:
  - description: A variable is defined to hold the count.
    key: define
    extra: >
      There's nothing magical about the name of the variable here.
      Instead of `count`, you could use `fingers` or `place` or whatever makes the most sense to you.

assessment:
  - question: The first time the condition is evaluated, what is the value of the `count` variable?
    answer: `1`
    rationale: >
      The count variable is initialized with a value of `1`.
      This value is not modified before the loop begins.

    refs:
      - title: Variables
        slug: learn/variables
  - question: When the condition eventually evaluates to `false`, what is the value of the `count` variable?
    answer: `6`
    rationale: >
      The first time through the loop, the count starts at `1` and is incremented to `2`.
      Next time through, the count is modified from `2` to `3`, then `3` to `4`, and `4` to `5`.
      Because the condition expression evaluates as `true` when the count is `5`, the loop body runs a fifth time.
      In that fifth time through, the count is incremented from `5` to `6`.
      When the condition is evaluated again, it is now `false` as `6` is not less than or equal to `5`.
  - question: Which parts of the code are repeated in the loop?
    answer: The loop body, which is a block and could have many lines of code, will be executed each time the loop is repeated.

  - question: How many times would the loop execute if you changed the expression from "less than or equal" to just "less than"?
    answer: `4`
    rationale: >
      The first time through the loop, the count starts at `1` and is incremented to `2`.
      Next time through, the count is modified from `2` to `3`, then `3` to `4`, and `4` to `5`.
      When the condition is evaluated, `5` is no longer "less than" `5`, so the condition is `false` and the loop does not run the fifth time.

  - question: What would happen if you did not increment the count variable inside the loop body?
    answer: The count would never change, leading to an infinite loop.
    rationale: >
      The count variable is initialized with the value `1`.
      If it is never updated within the loop, that value of `1` will never change, and the expression "`1` is less than or equal to `5`" will always be `true`.
      Since the condition is always `true`, the loop will never end.
