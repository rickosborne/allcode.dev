# Literal Values

Source code will often include values which are already known at the time you're writing it.
Because these values are part of the code, which needs to be read and updated by humans, it makes sense to format them in ways we can easily understand.

> **Literal values**, most often just called "literals", are a human-readable representations of value embedded in the source code itself.

These literals are often used to [initialize variables](/learn/variable-assignment/) or [constants](/learn/constants/).
Simple values like [numbers](/learn/numbers/), [Booleans](/learn/booleans/), and [strings](/learn/strings), sometimes called "**scalar**" values, are represented similarly by most programming languages.

More complex data types can also be represented by literals.
Some languages include syntax for array or collection literals, function literals, and more.

# Next Steps

* [Variables](/learn/variables/) keep track of your values.
* [Constants](/learn/constants/) are fixed values, often numbers, which never change when your code is run.
