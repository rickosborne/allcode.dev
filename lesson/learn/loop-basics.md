## Loop Examples

This example counts from 1 to 5 using `while` loop.
It doesn't do anything with the count for now.
Most languages have more natural and specific syntax for counting and range loops.

!walkthrough counting-with-while-loop



As you can see in all the languages above:

* A variable is used to hold the count.
* That variable is **initialized** with a value of `1`.
* The `while` keyword evaluates a condition at the start of each time through (iteration of) the loop.
* The condition evaluates to `true` as long as the count is less than or equal to `5`.
* The **loop body** increments the counting variable.
