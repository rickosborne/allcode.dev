# Variable Assignment

Changing the value of a variable is called **assignment**.
Most languages follow the same convention: the variable name followed by `=` (equals) and the value.

In the example above, you see:

* The numeric value `3` assigned to the variable for "count".
* The string (text) value "blue" assigned to the variable for "favorite color".
* The Boolean `false` value assigned to the variable named "hungry now".
  Note that some languages just use `0` (zero) for this, while others have a `false` keyword.

Other things you'll notice:

* Some languages add characters like `$` (dollar sign) to some variables to help identify them.
  For example, BASIC adds one at the end for [string](/learn/strings/) (text) variables.
  Perl puts them at the beginning.
* Pascal uses `:=` for assignment, while most other languages use `=` by itself.
  Some other, more exotic languages use other things like `<-` and more.
