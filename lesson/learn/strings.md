# Strings

Most code will need to work with human-readable text.
That text might be part of the user interface, or the errors or logging messages, or anything else a person might need to see.

::: walkthrough string-variables
:::

In the example above, you see:

* Two string [variables](/learn/variables/).
* The first string uses Latin characters.
* The second string uses an emoji, which is Unicode.

Explaining the differences between Latin and Unicode is well beyond the scope of this lesson.
Wikipedia has [a huge article on Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode).
The short version is that behind the scenes your programming language and operating system need to do some heavy lifting to figure out exactly how to display human-readable text, because there are many human-readable languages in the world, all with their own rules.
